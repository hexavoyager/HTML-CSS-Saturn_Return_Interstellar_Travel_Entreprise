                The city was called Septentrion, and in its current incarnation it was more than seventy thousand years
                old. It was said there were other cities yet remaining on the Earth, but it was long since word of any
                of them had been much more than rumor, and Septentrion was the oldest and the largest. Three-fourths of
                the remaining population of the Earth made their homes here within Septentrion’s walls, where the
                mirrors and the latent heat of the world’s core still kept land and sea free of the ice ten months of
                the year: thirty million of the living, tens of millions of motiles, millions of sessile ghosts
                inextricable from the fabric of the city, uncountable billions of computationals and functionals, and
                this was not a tenth of what the city had held at its peak.
