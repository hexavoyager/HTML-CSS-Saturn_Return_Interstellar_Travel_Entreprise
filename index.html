                The ship was a billion years old, and it was
                dying. The incalculable energies that had forced open the
                metric to permit its passage were all but spent, and now the relentless quintessence was taking over
                again: pulling the metric tighter, so that from instant to instant the needle-eye the ship tried to
                thread was that much narrower, the forces pulling the ship apart that much stronger. Fields that could
                have carried the ship intact through the event horizon of a stellar-mass black hole were tearing like
                dry paper; decks and bulkheads built to withstand the heat and pressure at the heart of a star were
                being ground away in a shower of exotic particles that decayed instantly to pure radiation and were
                gone. <br><br>
